#----------------------------------
The virtual environment
#----------------------------------

venv to create the isolated Python environment. Modules installed in this virtual environment are independent from the ones installed in your local/system Python

To create a Python environment, type the following commands in your project root directory

python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate 
pip install -e .

1. The first command creates a Python environment. This will make a directory named venv in your project structure.
2. The second command will activate the Python environment created.
3. The last command will run setup.py and install/setup the project.


python setup.py --version

Specifying the project version in __version__ variable, allows you to access it during CI and use it to generate a path, where you will store artefacts (i.e. seed_module and main.py)
